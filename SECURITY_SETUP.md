# Security Setup Guide

This project has been secured with comprehensive security measures. Follow these steps to complete the security configuration:

## ✅ Completed Security Features

### Database Security
- ✅ Restricted RLS policies on vendor profiles
- ✅ Audit logging system for security events
- ✅ Input validation functions
- ✅ Secure file upload system with type validation
- ✅ Storage bucket with proper access controls

### Application Security
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Rate limiting for authentication
- ✅ Strong password requirements
- ✅ Security event logging
- ✅ XSS and SQL injection protection

## 🚨 Required Manual Configuration

### 1. Enable Leaked Password Protection
**Priority: HIGH**

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/bsowliifibqtgracbpgt/auth/providers
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Authentication** → **Password Protection**
3. Enable **"Check for leaked passwords"**
4. This prevents users from using compromised passwords

### 2. Database Security Patches
**Priority: MEDIUM**

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/bsowliifibqtgracbpgt/settings/general
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **General** → **Database**
3. Click **"Upgrade"** to apply the latest security patches
4. Schedule this during low-usage periods

## 🔒 Security Features Implemented

### Authentication Security
- **Rate Limiting**: 5 attempts per minute for auth operations
- **Strong Passwords**: Requires uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Security Logging**: All auth events are logged for monitoring

### Data Protection
- **Restricted Vendor Data**: Public only sees basic business info
- **Audit Trail**: All sensitive operations are logged
- **File Upload Security**: 5MB limit, type restrictions, secure storage
- **RLS Policies**: Row-level security protects all data access

### Input Security
- **XSS Protection**: HTML tags and JavaScript blocked
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Dangerous SQL patterns blocked
- **Length Validation**: All inputs have maximum lengths
- **Content Sanitization**: User content is cleaned before storage

## 📊 Security Monitoring

### Audit Logs
View security events in the database:
```sql
SELECT * FROM public.security_audit_logs 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Common Security Events
- `signin_success` / `signin_failed`
- `signup_success` / `signup_failed`
- `quote_submitted` / `quote_submission_failed`
- `suspicious_input_detected`
- `file_uploaded` / `file_upload_failed`

## 🛡️ Additional Security Recommendations

### 1. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Consider enabling MFA for admin accounts in Supabase dashboard.

### 2. Regular Security Reviews
- Review audit logs monthly
- Monitor for suspicious patterns
- Update dependencies regularly

### 3. Backup Strategy
Ensure regular database backups are configured in Supabase settings.

### 4. SSL/TLS Configuration
Verify HTTPS is enforced for your domain in production.

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **File Uploads**: Only authenticated users can upload to the `secure-uploads` bucket
- **Data Access**: Vendors can only see their own data and active quote requests
- **Password Security**: Minimum 8 characters with complexity requirements
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks on authentication

## 📞 Security Incident Response

If you notice suspicious activity:
1. Check audit logs for patterns
2. Review failed authentication attempts
3. Consider temporarily disabling affected accounts
4. Update passwords for compromised accounts
